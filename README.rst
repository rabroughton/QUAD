Quantitative Uncertainty Analysis for Diffraction (QUAD)
====

This is a research tool that allows analysis of X-ray and neutron
diffraction data to infer the structure of materials with quantifiable 
uncertainty. QUAD uses Bayesian statistics and Markov chain sampling 
algorithms, together with components from the open source GSAS-II package, 
to create posterior probability distributions on all material structure 
parameters modeled by researchers.

While the tool has been used for several research projects, a formal Python package is still under development.  A useable version of the package is expected to be available in the summer of 2019.
