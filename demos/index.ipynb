    "# Quantitative Uncertainty Analysis for Diffraction [(QUAD)](https://github.com/rabroughton/QUAD) Tutorials\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is QUAD?\n",
    "The QUAD package is a Python program that employs a Bayesian statistical approach to fit full-profile x-ray and neutron diffraction patterns. The package interfaces with the crystallography software package [GSAS-II](https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS) [1]. Material sample, structural, lattice, and instrumental parameters that are determined through a least-squares Rietveld refinement in GSAS-II can also be refined with this alternative Bayesian framework in QUAD. In Bayesian inference, parameters are taken to be random variables having associated posterior distributions, as illustrated in the example figure below. A posterior distribution displays the probability of obtaining the possible values for an unknown parameter after taking into account the data and the provided prior information. This representation provides higher fidelity uncertainty quantification on the parameters and model fits [2]. The sampling algorithm used to perform the Bayesian refinement is Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM).\n",

    "#### What is DRAM?\n",
    "Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) is a version of a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. More about the algorithm selection process can be found in the book chapter \"Algorithms in Diffraction Profile Analysis\" [3]. MCMC methods, such as DRAM, are commonly employed in Bayesian statistics to sample from the posterior distributions of parameters in a model. A complete understanding of Bayesian statistics and DRAM sampling is not necessary for the operation and use of QUAD. However, it is important to understand that we will be looking at distributions of parameter samples that fit the diffraction data and not single point estimates for parameter values that define one best-fit model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why would I want to use this for my research?\n",
    "The results from QUAD can enrich the information from point estimate and standard uncertainty results obtained through a least-squares Rietveld refinement. The Bayesian full profile refinement provides descriptive insight to the uncertainties in the material parameters. If a diffraction pattern is not fitting well, QUAD results can help point to where the errors in the model may lie through observations of convergence and parameter identifiability. Additionally, with the Bayesian methodology, prior knowledge and previous experimental information can be incorporated by specifying upper and lower bound values on the parameters, which allows the sampling space to be limited to only physically realistic parameter values. Through QUAD, parameter covariances and relationships can also be examined. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorials below will guide you through how to setup and run QUAD and will highlight different capabilities of the package through specific case studies. This tool is currently a work in progress with more tutorials coming soon. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, please email rabrough@ncsu.edu. \n",

    "## Installation and Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The code package can be found on the GitHub [QUAD project page](https://github.com/rabroughton/QUAD). The code was developed in Python 3.7 and is compatible with the most recent version of GSAS-II in Python 3.7 (version 4783, January 26th, 2021). The repository can be cloned and saved locally and you can run `python setup.py install` to download the software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the master branch can be installed through pip install. This branch is typically kept up to date with the most recent developments. "

    "If you are new to Python, have trouble with the installation, or woud like a detailed installation explanation, see **Tutorial1: Installation Instructions** to begin. \n",
    "\n",
    "A python script will need to be written in order to initialize the inputs, call the software, and manage the outputs. A [SPYDER](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) integrated development environement was used for development, but the environment or notebook for the fitting script is left to the preference of the user. An example fitting script can be found on the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/rabroughton/QUAD) in the 'demos' folder. This is accompanied by an example data file for running the script in the same folder. It is recommend to start with **Tutorial 2: Setting up a calling script and running QUAD**, which guides the user through the process of setting up a fitting script to run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is dependent on a program called GSAS-II. Installation instructions can be found on the [GSAS-II webpage](https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS). It is recommended, but not necessary, to install the GSAS-II software through the Anaconda download if possible on your machine. Note that the GSAS-II software is regularly updated and we will try to maintain the functionality of QUAD with these updates. GSAS-II updates can be installed by opening the GSAS-II program and navigating to Help>Check for Updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the QUAD package and GSAS-II software are installed, you can begin your Bayesian refinement of a diffraction profile. Please see the tutorials for more information and guidance. Once the installation is complete, it is recommended to begin with tutorial #2 \"Setting up a calling script\", and then follow the tutorials in numerical order. Data files for the examples can be downloaded HERE. \n",
